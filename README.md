# vforce_group_manager
Making a simple group manager page for fun with visualforce and apex. I had previously run into issues when I needed to add some deactivated users to a group for custom reporting in a vforce page with an apex controller. Apparently, SF doesn't want you adding Deactivated users to groups through the GUI in Setup. You can get around this by opening your browser inspector and changing the selected user IDs within the multi-picklist (tutorial to come), but this is not intuitive if you have many inactive users to add. SF doesn't appear to have server-side validation to prevent deactivated users from being added to a group - only client-side validation which can be bypassed. This is just going to be a fun proof of concept.
